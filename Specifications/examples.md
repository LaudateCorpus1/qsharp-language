# Working with Qubits


## Borrowing Qubits

In the canon there are examples that use the `borrowing` keyword, for instance the function `MultiControlledXBorrow` defined below.
If `controls` denotes the control qubits that should be added to an `X` operation, then an overall of `Length(controls)-2` many dirty ancillas will be added by this implementation.

```qsharp
operation MultiControlledXBorrow ( controls : Qubit[] , target : Qubit ) : Unit
is Adj + Ctl {

    body (...) {
        ... // skipping some case handling here
        let numberOfDirtyQubits = numberOfControls - 2;
        borrowing( dirtyQubits = Qubit[ numberOfDirtyQubits ] ) {

            let allQubits = [ target ] + dirtyQubits + controls;
            let lastDirtyQubit = numberOfDirtyQubits;
            let totalNumberOfQubits = Length(allQubits);

            let outerOperation1 = 
                CCNOTByIndexLadder(
                    numberOfDirtyQubits + 1, 1, 0, numberOfDirtyQubits , _ );
            
            let innerOperation = 
                CCNOTByIndex(
                    totalNumberOfQubits - 1, totalNumberOfQubits - 2, lastDirtyQubit, _ );
            
            WithA(outerOperation1, innerOperation, allQubits);
            
            let outerOperation2 = 
                CCNOTByIndexLadder(
                    numberOfDirtyQubits + 2, 2, 1, numberOfDirtyQubits - 1 , _ );
            
            WithA(outerOperation2, innerOperation, allQubits);
        }
    }

    controlled(extraControls, ...) {
        MultiControlledXBorrow( extraControls + controls, target );
    }
}
```

Note that extensive use of the `With` combinator---in its form that is applicable for operations that support adjoint, i.e., `WithA`---was made in this example.
This is good programming style, because adding control to structures involving `With` propagates control only to the inner operation.
Further, note that here in addition to the `body` of the operation, an implementation of the `controlled` body of the operation was explicitly provided, rather than resorting to a `controlled auto` statement.
The reason for this is that we know from the structure of the circuit how to easily add further controls which is beneficial compared to adding control to each and every individual gate in the `body`. 

It is instructive to compare this code with another canon function `MultiControlledXClean` which achieves the same goal of implementing a multiply-controlled `X` operation, however, which uses several clean qubits using the `using` mechanism. 


# Repeat-Until-Success

## RUS pattern for single qubit rotation about an irrational axis 

In a typical use case, the following Q# operation implements a rotation around an irrational axis of $(I + 2i Z)/\sqrt{5}$ on the Bloch sphere. This is accomplished by using a known RUS pattern:

```qsharp
operation ApplyVRotationUsingRUS(qubit : Qubit) : Unit {
    using (controls = Qubit[2]) {
        ApplyToEachA(H, controls);
        mutable finished = false;
        repeat {
            Controlled X(controls, qubit);
            S(qubit);
            Controlled X(controls, qubit);
            Z(qubit);
        }
        until (finished)
        fixup {
            if (MeasureIfAllQubitsAreZero(controls, PauliX)) {
                set finished = true;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## RUS loop with mutable variable in scope

This example shows the use of a mutable variable `finished` which is in scope of the entire repeat-until-fixup loop and which gets initialized before the loop and updated in the fixup step.

```qsharp
mutable iter = 1;
repeat {
    ProbabilisticCircuit(qubits);
    let success = ComputeSuccessIndicator(qubits);
}
until (success || iter > maxIter)
fixup {
    iter += 1;
    ComputeCorrection(qubits);
}
```

## RUS without `fixup`

For example, the following code is a probabilistic circuit that implements an important rotation gate $V_3 = (\boldone + 2 i Z) / \sqrt{5}$ using the `H` and `T` gates.
The loop terminates in $\frac{8}{5}$ repetitions on average.
See [*Repeat-Until-Success: Non-deterministic decomposition of single-qubit unitaries*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.1074) (Paetznick and Svore, 2014) for more details.

```qsharp
using (qubit = Qubit()) {
    repeat {
        H(qubit);
        T(qubit);
        CNOT(target, qubit);
        H(qubit);
        Adjoint T(qubit);
        H(qubit);
        T(qubit);
        H(qubit);
        CNOT(target, qubit);
        T(qubit);
        Z(target);
        H(qubit);
        let result = M(qubit);
    } until (result == Zero);
}
```

## RUS to prepare a quantum state

Finally, we show an example of a RUS pattern to prepare a quantum state $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\left(\sqrt{2}\ket{0}+\ket{1}\right)$, starting from the $\ket{+}$ state.
See also the [unit testing sample provided with the standard library](https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum/blob/master/samples/diagnostics/unit-testing/RepeatUntilSuccessCircuits.qs):

```qsharp
operation PrepareStateUsingRUS(target : Qubit) : Unit {
    using (auxiliary = Qubit()) {
        H(auxiliary);
        repeat {
            // We expect the target and auxiliary qubits to each be in
            // the |+> state.
            AssertProb(
                [PauliX], [target], Zero, 1.0,
                "target qubit should be in the |+> state", 1e-10 );
            AssertProb(
                [PauliX], [auxiliary], Zero, 1.0,
                "auxiliary qubit should be in the |+> state", 1e-10 );

            Adjoint T(auxiliary);
            CNOT(target, auxiliary);
            T(auxiliary);

            // The probability of measuring |+> state on the auxiliary qubit
            // is 3/4.
            AssertProb(
                [PauliX], [auxiliary], Zero, 3. / 4.,
                "Error: the probability to measure |+> in the first
                auxiliary must be 3/4",
                1e-10);

            // If we get the measurement outcome Zero, we prepare the
            // required state.
            let outcome = Measure([PauliX], [auxiliary]);
        }
        until (outcome == Zero)
        fixup {
            // Bring the auxiliary and target qubits back to |+> state.
            if (outcome == One) {
                Z(auxiliary);
                X(target);
                H(target);
            }
        }
        // Return the auxiliary qubit back to the Zero state.
        H(auxiliary);
    }
}
```

Notable programmatic features shown in this operation are a more complex `fixup` part of the loop, which involves quantum operations, and the use of `AssertProb` statements to ascertain the probability of measuring the quantum state at certain specified points in the program.
